    Investigations of some of the bee fauna of all three neighboring states were recently completed and one is in progress for Quebec. Yet only Massachusetts surveyed the entire bee fauna. About 125 species are known from New England that haven’t yet been found in Vermont. Many of these are southern and coastal species and unlikely to occur here, but there may be 30 to 50 of those species that could occur here.

    As the northwestern most state in New England, Vermont has some more western species such as the Texas Mason (<i>Osmia texana</i>), Rugose-fronted Resin Bee (<i>Megachile rugifrons</i>), and the Simple Longhorn-Cuckoo (<i>Triepeolus simplex</i>) not found elsewhere in the region.

    Despite targeted survey efforts in montane and boreal biophysical regions, records of more northern boreal species are few. The cooler areas of the state do have a relatively distinct bee community, characterized by several species including the Cinquefoil Masked Bee (<i>Hylaeus basalis</i>), White-fronted Small-Mason (<i>Hoplitis albifrons</i>), and the Proximal Mason (<i>Osmia proxima</i>) that are uncommon to rare south of the conifer-hardwood transition zone.
