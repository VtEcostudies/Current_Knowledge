Understanding the natural history of each species can reveal important aspects that are necessary for conservation action to be successful. Not all bee species are alike. Even within a single bee genus, there can be significant variation in social structure, phenology, nesting locations, and diet. Some species are active as adults for less than a month and spend the rest of the year as larva and pupa in a nest. Others however overwinter as adults and are flying from April through October, with multiple generations during the summer.

Nesting is a crucial part of their annual cycle that remains woefully understudied. While broad nesting habits are known or can be inferred for most species, little is known about the specific nesting requirements for most species. Bare, loose soil and above ground cavities are the two most common nest sites that are used by the majority of species. Additionally, thick leaf litter and rotten logs are important overwintering habitats for a number of species. <a href="https://xerces.org/publications/fact-sheets/nesting-overwintering-habitat#:~:text=The%20availability%20of%20nesting%20and,support%20pollinators%20and%20other%20wildlife" target = "blank_">Learn more about r habitat management for nesting and overwintering sites </a>from the Xerces Society.
