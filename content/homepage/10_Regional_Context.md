<h4> 
At least 8 species have been recorded in Vermont that are not known to occur any where else in New England

Investigations of some of the bee fauna of all three neighboring states were recently completed and is in progress in Quebec. Only Massachusetts addressed the all bee fauna. About 125 species are known from New England that havenâ€™t yet been found in Vermont. Many of these are southern and coastal species and unlikely to occur here, although 30-50 of those species are considered possible within Vermont. 

As the northwestern most state in New England, Vermont has some more western species (i.e., <i> Andrena chromotricha</i>, <i>Osmia texana</i>, <i>Megachile rugifrons</i>, <i>Epeolus canadensis</i>, <i>Epeolus minimus</i>, <i>Perdita maculigera</i>, <i>Triepeolus simplex</i>, and <i>Svastra obliqua</i>) not found elsewhere in the region.  Despite targeted survey efforts, records of truly boreal species are few, though the cooler parts of the state have a relatively distinct bee community, characterized by several species that are uncommon to rare south of the conifer-hardwood transition zone.
