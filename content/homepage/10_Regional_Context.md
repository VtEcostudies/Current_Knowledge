Investigations of some of the bee fauna of all three neighboring states were recently completed and is in progress in Quebec. Only Massachusetts surveyed the entire bee fauna. About 125 species are known from New England that havenâ€™t yet been found in Vermont. Many of these are southern and coastal species and unlikely to occur here, but there may be  30 to50 of those species that could occur here.

As the northwestern most state in New England, Vermont has some more western species (i.e., <i> Andrena chromotricha</i>, <i>Osmia texana</i>, <i>Megachile rugifrons</i>, <i>Epeolus canadensis</i>, <i>Epeolus minimus</i>, <i>Perdita maculigera</i>, <i>Triepeolus simplex</i>, and <i>Svastra obliqua</i>) not found elsewhere in the region.  

Despite targeted survey efforts in montane and boreal biophysical regions, records of more northern boreal species are few. The cooler areas of the state do have a relatively distinct bee community, characterized by several species (i.e. <i>Hylaeus basalis</i>,  <i> Hoplitis albifrons</i>, and <i>Osmia proxima</i>) that are uncommon to rare south of the conifer-hardwood transition zone.
