Wild bees have been recorded in every biophysical region and nearly every town. The Vermont Wild Bee Survey made a concerted effort to visit the full spectrum of bee habitats. However, sampling effort was far from uniform across the state. Recent sampling has been concentrated around the population centers in Chittenden and Washington counties, while historical collecting was biased geographically by a small number of prolific collectors based in East Dorset, Middlebury, and Castleton. The 4,254 records we have from the 20th century provide some insight into past bee communities.
