Vermont has the highest per capita engagement with <a href="https://www.inaturalist.org/places/vermont-us" target=blank_>iNaturalist</a> and by far the highest proportion of bee species that have been recorded on the platform (49% vs. approximately 20% nationally). More than 1,500 people have submitted <a href=”https://www.inaturalist.org/projects/vermont-wild-bee-survey”>photo-observations of bees </a>, including several that were new species for the state. Crowd-source platforms are likely to continue growing and will probably become the largest and fastest source of data on bee distributions and phenology.
