    The pollination services that our agricultural systems rely on come from an incredible variety of wild bees. More than 10% of the bee records known from the state were collected off plants that have at least some commercial food value. The plants included in this figure range from Sugar Maples to potatoes, though much of the agricultural focus on pollination revolves around fruits, many of which are dependent on insect pollination to produce a crop. Much of the Vermont data on agricultural pollination comes from <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0167880918304419" target="blank_"><u> a University of Vermont study</u></a> study on Blueberries and Raspberries that showed wild bee pollination improved not only the quantity but also the quality of crops.

    Farmers and honey bees arenâ€™t the only ones that benefit from these interactions - of the top 20 wild bees found on crops, only one (Wilke's Miner) is non-native. Several crops, including blueberries, sunflowers, squash, tomatillos, and ground cherries are the hosts of specialist bees - including two watchlist species!
