Systematic surveys of wild bees in Vermont began only recently. Historic bee collections were often incidental and limited in scope. In 2012, the Vermont Bumble Bee Atlas (VBBA) began a multi-year effort to assess the statewide status of the 17 Bumble Bee (<i>Bombus</i>) species historically known from the state. Seven years later, the Vermont Wild Bee Survey (VTBees) expanded this effort to the other 38 genera of wild bees. <b>These projects amassed more than 10,000 occurrence records.</b> Combined with historical collections reaching back more than a century, these data provide the first comprehensive understanding of wild bees across Vermont. 

The earliest known wild bee records reach back to the 1800s. These priceless early collections in our natural history museums allow us to peer back in time, but despite these early efforts, only 158 species are known to have been collected prior to 1962. Today, after a decade of field work, the list of species known to occur in Vermont has crested at over 350 wild bee species and the relative abundance and distribution for most is known.

There are certainly still species within the state that have not yet been documented, and the status of others remains unclear. Additionally, the bee community is far from static. Several introduced species are known to occur in neighboring states and are predicted to become established in Vermont in the near future. Changes within the native fauna are also happening, but can remain undetected without population monitoring. A decade of standardized bumble bee surveys show gradual, but significant changes in species diversity and relative abundance of some species that would not be detected without population monitoring.
