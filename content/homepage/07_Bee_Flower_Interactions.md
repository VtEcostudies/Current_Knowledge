<h4> Some specialized bees only collect pollen from a single plant species</h4>
</div>

Over 20,000 observation records of bee-plant interactions revealed that 225 bee species visited at least 438 different plant species in 92 families. These interactions provide important information about diet preferences for bees, which in turn is useful for designing management plans and other conservation actions.

Many bee species are<a href="https://jarrodfowler.com/specialist_bees.html" target="_blank"> specialists </a> and only feed their offspring pollen from a single genus or species of plant. Even specialists will occasionally visit other flowers to feed on nectar. On the other hand, generalists use pollen from an assortment of unrelated plant species. For example, Common Eastern Bumble Bee (<i>Bombus impatiens</i>), has been associated with 159 different plant genera in Vermont alone.

    Use the interactive figure to explore the bee-flower interaction data. Plant families with ≥10 bee observations are shown across the bottom and Bee genus is shown on the left. The colors represent the number of observations with darker colors indicating more observations. Click and enlarge areas on the figure to explore more details. Click on a Bee genus or a plant family to highlight a row or column, respectively. Mouse over a cell to see the number of observations.
