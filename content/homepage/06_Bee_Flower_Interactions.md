<h4> Some specialized bees only collect pollen from a single plant species</h4>
</div>

The pollination services that our agricultural systems rely on come from an incredible variety of wild bee species. Over 100 species of bees have been recorded visiting food crops in Vermont. <b>Wild bees are essential to the production of many food crops</b> including apples, blueberries, squash, raspberries, and many vegetables. Recent <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0167880918304419" target="blank_">findings from the University of Vermont</a> show wild bee pollination improves not only the quantity but also the quality of crops.

Over 10,000 observation records of bee-plant interactions revealed that 250 bee species visited at least 438 different plant species (in 92 families). These observations included 1,000 unique bee-flower combinations. Many bee species are specialists and are only associatied with a single plant genus/species while other species use an assortment of unrelated plant species. For example, <i>Bombus impatiens</i>, a generalist, was associated with 50 different plant species. 

Not all plant nector is created equal. Several plant genera (<i>Salix, Physalis</i>, etc) are used extensively by specialist bees, likely due to phenology, morphology, or chemical characteristics of the plant that limit their value to generalist bees.
