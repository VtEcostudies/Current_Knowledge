<h4> Some specialized bees only collect pollen from a single plant species</h4>

The pollination services that our agricultural systems rely on come from an incredible variety of wild bee species. At least 175 species of bees have been recorded visiting food crops in Vermont. <b>Wild bees are essential to the production of many food crops</b> including apples, blueberries, squash, raspberries, and many vegetables. Recent <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0167880918304419" target="blank_">findings from the University of Vermont</a> show wild bee pollination improves not only the quantity but also the quality of crops.

Over 20,000 observation records of bee-plant interactions revealed that 225 bee species visited at least 438 different plant species in 92 families. These observations included 1,000 unique bee-flower combinations. Many bee species are specialists and are only associated with a single genus or species of plant, while other bees use an assortment of unrelated plant species. For example, Common Eastern Bumble Bee (<i>Bombus impatiens</i>), a generalist, was associated with 159 different plant genera.

Not all plant nectar is created equal. Several plant genera (Willows, Ground Cherries, etc) are used extensively by specialist bees, likely due to phenology, morphology, or chemical characteristics of the plant that limit their value to generalist bees.
