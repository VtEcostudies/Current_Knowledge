<h4> 50,000+ Vermont bee records are available in the Vermont Atlas of Life Data Explorer</h4>

We have transformed historic museum collections and all of our modern surveys into digital datasets that are open and freely available online. More than 50,000 Vermont bee records are now available from the Vermont Atlas of Life and published at the [Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF)](https://www.gbif.org/occurrence/taxonomy?taxon_key=4334&taxon_key=7901&taxon_key=7908&taxon_key=4345&taxon_key=7905&taxon_key=7911&gadm_gid=USA.46_1) 

Nearly 1,500 community scientists joined our efforts on [iNaturalist](https://www.inaturalist.org/projects/vermont-atlas-of-life) to document bee diversity across the state, recording about half of Vermont's species and accounting for nearly a quarter of all occurrence records. <b>Vermont has the highest per-capita engagement with iNaturalist and far and away the highest proportion of bee species that have been recorded on the platform (49% vs. ~20% nationally)</b>. We hope to continue to grow Crowd-sourced efforts to become the largest and fastest source of data on bee distribution and phenology for the region.
