Historic bee collections were often incidental and limited in scope. In 2012, the Vermont Bumble Bee Atlas (VBBA) began a multi-year effort to assess the statewide status of the 17 Bumble Bee (<i>Bombus</i>) species historically known from the state. Seven years later, the Vermont Wild Bee Survey (VTBees) expanded this effort to the other 38 genera of wild bees. <b>These projects amassed more than 10,000 occurrence records.</b> Combined with historical collections reaching back more than a century, these data provide the first comprehensive understanding of wild bees across Vermont.</p><p>The earliest known wild bee records reach back to the 1800s. These priceless early collections in our natural history museums allow us to peer back in time, but despite these early efforts, only 158 species are known to have been collected prior to 1962. Today, after a decade of field work, the list of species known to occur in Vermont has crested at over 350 wild bee species and the relative abundance and distribution for most is known.</p><p>There are certainly still species within the state that have not yet been documented, and the status of others remains unclear. Additionally, the bee community is far from static. Several introduced species are known to occur in neighboring states and are predicted to become established in Vermont in the near future. Changes within the native fauna are also happening, but can remain undetected without population monitoring. A decade of standardized bumble bee surveys show gradual, but significant changes in species diversity and relative abundance of some species that would not be detected without population monitoring.</p></section></article><div class=post-after></div></div><div class=post-holder><article id=community-science-contributions class=post><header class=post-header><h2 class=post-title>Community Science Contributions</h2></header><section class=post-content><br><div class=lead><h4>Nearly half of the species and 22% of occurrence records came from community scientists!</h4></div><br><div class=doubleColumn><div><img alt="Peponapis male" src="images/Peponapis male.jpg" style=margin:0><p class=caption>Pruinose Squash Bee (<i>Peponapis pruinosa</i>) - A valuable pollinator of squash that has followed the domestication and spread of its host plant from its native range in Central America and the Southwestern US.</p></div><div>Vermont has the highest per-capita engagement with <a href=https://www.inaturalist.org/places/vermont-us target=blank_>iNaturalist</a> and far and away the highest proportion of bee species that have been recorded on the platform (49% vs. ~20% nationally).

Not all bee species are alike. Even within a single bee genus, there can be significant variation in social structure, phenology, nesting locations, and diet. Some species are active as adults for less than a month and spend the rest of the year as larva and pupa in a nest. Others however overwinter as adults and are flying from April through October, with multiple generations during the summer.</p><div class=row><div class=doubleColumn><div><img src="images/Brown-belted Bumble Bee (Bombus griseocollis) nest 20120613.jpg" style=width:75%></div><p>Nesting is a crucial part of their annual cycle that remains woefully understudied. While broad nesting habits are known or can be inferred for most species, little is known about the specific nesting requirements for most species. Bare, loose soil and above ground cavities are the two most common nest sites that are used by the majority of species. Additionally, thick leaf litter and rotten logs are important habitats for the overwintering of a number of species.

Over 100 species of bees have been recorded visiting food crops in Vermont. <b>Wild bees are essential to the production of many food crops</b> including apples, blueberries, squash, raspberries, and many vegetables. Recent <a href=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0167880918304419 target=blank_>findings from the University of Vermont</a> show wild bee pollination improves not only the quantity but also the quality of crops.</p><p>Over 10,000 observation records of bee-plant interactions revealed that 250 bee species visited at least 438 different plant species (in 92 families). These observations included 1,000 unique bee-flower combinations. Many bee species are specialists and are only associatied with a single plant genus/species while other species use an assortment of unrelated plant species. For example, <i>Bombus impatiens</i>, a generalist, was associated with 50 different plant species.</p><p>Not all plant nector is created equal. Several plant genera (<i>Salix, Physalis</i>, etc) are used extensively by specialist bees, likely due to phenology, morphology, or chemical characteristics of the plant that limit their value to generalist bees.</p><div style=width:100%;height:100%><iframe src=https://vt-ecostudies-atlas.shinyapps.io/wildbee_interactions onload='(function(e){e.style.height=e.contentWindow.document.body.scrollHeight+"px"})(this)' style=height:500px;width:100%;border:none;overflow:hidden></iframe></iframe></div><p style=font-size:10pt;text-align:right;margin-right:3%><a href=https://vtecostudies.github.io/SoBees_LandingPage/>Home</a> | <a href=https://vtecostudies.github.io/SoBees_Threats/>Threats</a> | <a href=https://vtecostudies.github.io/SoBees_Conservation/>Conservation</a> | <a href=https://vtecostudies.github.io/SoBees_Next_Steps/>Next Steps</a></p></section></article><div class=post-after></div></div><div class=post-holder><article id=regional-context class='post last'><header class=post-header><h2 class=post-title>Regional Context</h2></header><section class=post-content><br><div class=lead><h4>At least 8 species have been recorded in Vermont that are not known to occur any where else in New England</h4></div><br>Investigations of some of the bee fauna of all three neighboring states were recently completed and is in progress in Quebec. Only Massachusetts addressed the all bee fauna. About 125 species are known from New England that haven’t yet been found in Vermont. Many of these are southern and coastal species and unlikely to occur here, although 30-50 of those species are considered possible within Vermont.<p>As the northwestern most state in New England, Vermont has some more western species (i.e., <i>Andrena chromotricha</i>, <i>Osmia texana</i>, <i>Megachile rugifrons</i>, <i>Epeolus canadensis</i>, <i>Epeolus minimus</i>, <i>Perdita maculigera</i>, <i>Triepeolus simplex</i>, and <i>Svastra obliqua</i>) not found elsewhere in the region.
